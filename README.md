# ‚ö°Ô∏è MyAwesomeWebFramework
A simple web framework that includes a custom implementation of the Virtual DOM and a Reconciliation algorithm.

## üöÄ About the Project
MyAwesomeWebFramework is a learning project designed to explore how web frameworks handle UI updates using a custom Virtual DOM and reconciliation process. It is intended for educational purposes and experimentation, providing insight into how these concepts work under the hood.

Please note: This framework is not production-ready and is not intended for integration into real-world projects.

## ‚ú® Features
* Custom Virtual DOM: A minimal implementation of the Virtual DOM to practice working with efficient UI updates.
* State Manager: A simple state management system to keep track of UI state and trigger efficient re-renders.
* Reconciliation Algorithm: Basic reconciliation logic to compare and update the DOM based on state changes.
* Lightweight: Designed for simplicity and understanding, not for large-scale applications.
* Educational: Ideal for developers looking to understand Virtual DOM and reconciliation at a deeper level.
